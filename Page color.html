    In aviation, a task card (also called a job card or work card) is a standardized document that breaks down a maintenance task into clear, step-by-step instructions. Each task card is drawn from the aircraft’s approved maintenance data (e.g. the Airbus A320 or A350 Maintenance Manual) and is used on the shop floor to guide the work. A task card typically covers one specific inspection or repair action, specifying what to do and how to do it. In practice, engineers will create a task card by extracting relevant procedures from the manual and arranging them in a concise format. This makes it easier for mechanics to follow complex procedures on aircraft without having to page through the full manual.
